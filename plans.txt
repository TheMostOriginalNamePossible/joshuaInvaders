Things done:
    * Create a working game instance
    * Insert a player character inside game instance that can be controlled with mouse
    * GET THE LASER TO STOP FOLLOWING CHARACTER AFTER SHOT
    * get a working laser
    * figure out how to create/delete instances from the game (properly)
    * enemies can be damaged and "killed"
    * I FIXED THE VISUAL BUG LETS GO!!!!!
    * game can be paused without issues.
    * created a simple enemy wave
    * created a couple functional power ups
    * created start screen
    * created enemy bullet object with collision detection and limits on them. They also make player lose lives
    * Added some stat icons.
    * Made a win and game over screen and all buttons work properly
    * Created a functional pause menu. Game is paused when P is pressed.
    * Added a previous score in the win and game over screens. It'd be too much of a hassle to have it display
      previous score in the menu
    * I was playing a game Thursday and when you go back to the game from the being paused, it slows down the
    game to let you
    * Made a wave delay feature, so players aren't immediately damaged when the next wave
      is incoming.
