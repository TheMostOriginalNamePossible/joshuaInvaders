Things done:
    * Create a working game instance
    * Insert a player character inside game instance that can be controlled with mouse
    * GET THE LASER TO STOP FOLLOWING CHARACTER AFTER SHOT
    * get a working laser
    * figure out how to create/delete instances from the game (properly)
    * enemies can be damaged and "killed"
    * I FIXED THE VISUAL BUG LETS GO!!!!!
    * game can be paused without issues.
Important Goals:
    * Start Screen. it does immediately kill you at start
    * Game Over screen
Current Goals:
    * Implement a moving enemy.
    * Create enemy bullet object with collision detection with player
    * make functional power ups (working on)
    * Create an enemy wave
    * Make new hitboxes
    * Creating a pause menu
    * Implement timing to require it to wait so seconds after pressing
      continue to let players get their bearings (later) (might do pretty soon, figured out pause)
    * __mainLoop needs work.

So a couple end goals we need to reach towards:
    * figuring out how transition between waves.
    * figuring out how to do menus
Some extras if time permits
    * Fix Frame rate issue?
    * different weapons
    * making save data and formatting it
