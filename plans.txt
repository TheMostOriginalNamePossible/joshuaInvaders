Things done:
    * Create a working game instance
    * Insert a player character inside game instance that can be controlled with mouse
    * GET THE LASER TO STOP FOLLOWING CHARACTER AFTER SHOT
    * get a working laser
    * figure out how to create/delete instances from the game (properly)
    * enemies can be damaged and "killed"
    * I FIXED THE VISUAL BUG LETS GO!!!!!
    * game can be paused without issues.
    * created a simple enemy wave
    * created a couple functional power ups

    * Fix bullet start delay
    * Make wave delay and give indication of next wave
    * Implement timing to require it to wait so seconds after pressing
      continue to let players get their bearings (later) (might do pretty soon, figured out pause)
    * Make a readME.txt
Stretch:
    * Implement a moving enemy.
    * Create a new wave containing moving enemies

Some extras if time permits
    * new power ups
    * Fix Frame rate issue?
