Things done:
    * Create a working game instance
    * Insert a player character inside game instance that can be controlled with mouse
    * GET THE LASER TO STOP FOLLOWING CHARACTER AFTER SHOT
    * get a working laser
    * figure out how to create/delete instances from the game (properly)
Current Goals:
    * figure out why creating instances during game causes visual bugs (I may email my professor about it)
        ** I seem to have fixed the visual bug where the bullets would cover each other up with boxes, but
           the player character seems to still cover up sprites in a box around it.
        ** Also this is not all that important of an issue.
    * Implement a moving enemy.
    * Implement an enemy with player bullet collision detection
    * Create enemy bullet object with collision detection with player
    * make functional power ups (This may be dropped if it's too much of a pain)
    * Create new hitbox types
    * Create an enemy wave.


So a couple end goals we need to reach towards:
    *making save data and formatting it
    *figuring out how transition between waves.
    *figuring out how to do menus
